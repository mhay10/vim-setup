# vim-setup
This is a github repo that allows me to setup vim according to my prefrences quickly and easily.\
Just run `vim-setup.sh` as root and everything will be done for you.

On Windows, run `vim-setup.ps1` instead.

**Note:** This script will overwrite all current settings in vim. You have been warned.
