# vim-setup
This is a github repo that allows you to setup vim according to my prefrences quickly and easily.\
Just run `vim-setup.sh` as and everything will be done for you.\
Note: If you run `vim-setup.sh` as root, it will setup vim for the root user.\

For Windows run `vim-setup.ps1` in a powershell prompt.\

**Note:** This script will overwrite all current settings in vim. You have been warned.
